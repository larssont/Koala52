## Background
Koala52 was designed to be a versatile yet simple keyboard.

Before designing Koala52, I was using the [Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58) and the [Allium58](https://github.com/beekeeb/Allium58) for several years. They are excellent keyboards in their own regards, but I felt like I wanted to make some changes to make a keyboard that was more suitable for me. Most importantly, I wanted a smaller thumb cluster that felt comfortable for my thumbs. I wanted a thumb cluster that went slightly further outwards, without having to rely on either tucking or stretching my thumbs extensively. On top of that, I wanted much more aggressive colum staggering which matched my own fingers lengths better.

Inspiration was derived from a variety of keyboards, most notably the [IK Keyboard](https://github.com/ianmaclarty/ik) which features a similar layout but with less pronounced stagger.

As opposed to many newer smaller split ergo keyboards, I decided to retain the fourth row in order to have a dedicated number row. This was primarily done to make it more suitable for gaming, since many games rely on a the number row for switching between different items. If I wasn't playing games very often, I would probably ditch the number row.

I've also decided to forego the common OLED screen, instead opting to have a dedicated piezo speaker on each half. I made this choice since based on my experience, the screen provides little value to a typist that normally doesn't look at their keyboard (not to mention that most screens tend to be far to small, nor do they function well with heavy tenting). They can of course be visually pleasing, but I prioritized a pragmatic design.
